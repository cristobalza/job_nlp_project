23,3.0,Google Cloud has a lot of challenges,"Working at Google cloud has many challenges, and it seems like leadership does not understand them well. Managers are not well trained, they have many people who they manage, and they do not provide proactive advice or support. It is difficult to speak with leadership, and when leadership finally has time to connect, in my experience, I feel like I am never heard, and my issues take multiple ""at-bats"" to be solved.

35,3.0,Contractor Engineer at Google,"Depends on your department, but from what I've seen is contractors are held very low at Google. There is little to no flexibility, especially when asking for time-off. There is basically no support from managers expect to meet job quotas and contractors are severely underpaid compared to their full-time employed co-workers who do literally the same job. And no matter what, don't trust recruiters when they say conversion is possible. Seriously, with the recent re-orgs and budget changes, head-count availability changes almost daily. I've seen contractors either laid off after their contract ends or pushed to become a vendor so there's less limitations on how long they can work at Google. On the bright side, they are implementing a standard for contractors to get some more benefits from their hiring companies, can't say if this affects the hourly wage as I've left a while ago in search for better pay.","Free lunch, promise of better benefits for contractors","Tied to a leash, limited to 30 minute lunches, everyone goes off to enjoy Google events while Contractors stay to do the work, little to no growth available, some departments will flaunt high conversion rates in past, but nowadays there very little"

But safety protocols conflict with the speed that repairs MUST be accomplished. Eg: you must take shortcuts, like not wear globes when doing battery swaps, even if it's not safe.

However, I'd much rather give up all my perks for the opportunity to work from home instead.. * Was very frustrating from the perspective of an employee of a startup that was acquired.  After getting acquired, all the state-of-the-art competitive software had to be re-written to fit Google's standards: coding style, build tools, and software libraries and protocols.  This felt the opposite of freedom.  Also, it was super hard even getting our first code checked into the monolithic codebase, as no one in the company had ""readability"" in any programming languages.  As such, we had to hire folks from other parts of Google, as well as get ""buddies"" within Google to help review our code.  More handcuffs.... * Mostly young workforce, with many from privileged backgrounds, with highly materialistic wants.  ""Smart"" gets thrown around a lot.  There are many smart people, and also many weird characters.  As someone who came in through an acquisition, I increasingly felt that I just didn't belong there, as I'd skipped the entire interview process.. * A very stable build system and well-written tech stack, at the cost of severe NIH, overall developmental slowness, and very outdated tech.  No opportunity to code with React.js, a very dominant framework used outside of Google (competing with Angular 2). * Frontend developers are not really taken seriously.

639,2.0,Terrible departments make for terrible lives,"I almost never knew the ""greater picture"" of where my team was headed, because the entire department seemed to have no clue. I would be told something by someone on my team who heard it in passing from our manager, and then the exact opposite would happen in two weeks. Even when that manager quit, the same things kept happening, and even when I switched teams (within the same department), so I believe the entire department was rotting from the head..  I saw excessive amounts of waste at every turn. Corporate culture is one of laziness and complacency, to the point where trying to pick up extra work that is technically beyond the scope of your job title will actually penalize you. I had to argue for weeks to convince a senior engineer to make a one line, basic change to top of rack switch because he simply didn't want to do it, and there was literally no recourse for me (I quit before he did, if he ever did)..  There are also some really sketchy activity going on inside, and attempts at bringing said activity to light will most likely only end poorly for you..  Overall, it started off great when I was still enamored by the name ""Google"" and was but a lowly peon. But as my team members quickly quit and my responsibilities expanded to encompass their old duties (because hiring for your team is also a nightmare), I saw more and more of the grit beneath the glamor. I have no intention of ever working for Google again..  I do feel I need to say that the Facilities team gets stuff done, though.

I also learned to manage my time during each section because of different priorities. Overall, I think the hardest part was to learn all the technologies that were used for the tasks.

During my first few months at Google I learned a ton from internal resources and learning about their technical infrastructure.. + Overall good culture of transparency, giving voice to employees, and trying to make sure employees are happy.. + Good compensation..  Cons:. Google is huge, and this has a number of consequences. For one, many engineering teams move very slowly. Lots of red tape, and lots of huge systems to integrate with. Very deep management chains. For an individual contributor, decisions may be made many levels above you and you have very little input or context..  Depending on the team, it can be hard to have meaningful impact at Google. Some systems are so old they are already fully optimized, others are just so large that you're unlikely to touch more than a small piece or sub system. Most engineers at Google aren't solving the worlds hardest/funnest problems--their just manning the ship, making sure things don't break and adding small incremental improvements.

My only real issue is that despite many years working there, it's very hard to be made from a vendor to a permanent employee, and there is little room for advancement.

Unless you are excellent at what you do and happen to be at the right place at the right time, you'll probably do best to work there, get a solid reputation and skillset, and then use the Google name to go somewhere else.

Whether you come in as a contractor or a permanent employee, you definitely will get the experience of a lifetime. .  With that being said.. I do feel like contractors (known as TVCs) are treated differently. I still think there is an overall great culture, but I wish they gave TVCs some of the resources they give permanent employees. Part of the reason I'm open to other opportunities is that there really isn't a clear path to conversion, the line is pretty blurred. Not to mention you have to re-interview for it..  Google loves people that ""thrive in ambiguity"" but as a TVC it's a little concerning when you don't have much guidance on how to push for conversion. You are essentially doing the exact same job as permanent employees, but apart from good numbers they want to see other intangibles to really have a strong case for conversion. Some of the top performers on my team were TVCs but unfortunately are not at Google anymore because they didn't make it through the conversion process..  Would I take this job as a TVC again? Probably. I admire this company and love how much you grow as a professional. I am definitely still gonna give the conversion process a shot, but I'm also realistic and know I need to be keeping my options open.","Culture, Great Food, Great Ammenities, Great Work/Life Balance, Great people","Ambiguity, No clear career trajectory for TVCs"

You may think hear you have the charter to blaze a new trail, but you need to be careful, there is a lot of coopetition, and some people would like to see you fail. Some people are guarding their territory and they don't think they need to align with your new process or whatever - and they don't . It's a tough place for a new ""expert"" type who's charter involves change. Do a lot of listening, and find ways to align with people and pick their brain. Ask questions. And travel to meet remote people you need to work with, in person, with an agenda. The Compensation/Benefits are good. Some positions and in some teams you need to be politically adept. The culture in many teams is not exactly friendly, especially if some external perceptions of the team are negative - it can feel a bit paranoid. Don't give in to that, and be positive, find the right goals to lend your support to  and then help achieve them. Make an impact!","Free food and benefits are great, but you know why they are there","Google must be your life at first, Management is sometimes distant Having a life can be challenging."

So working for Google on contract is a very interesting experience. .  The in office perks are very nice, your co-workers and manager are great in that they are both nice people and very good at their jobs and you have very interesting things to work on on a challenging timeline. Its a very good place to be.. However, as a contractor, the company's actions make it clear they do not care about you at all. You don't have any job security, so you don't know if you'll be there in 6 months and you can only be there a maximum of 2 years regardless how much your team values you (unless there is budgetary miracle). There are regular meetings and  off-site events for team building that you are not invited to, which has rather the opposite effect. It doesn't matter how inclusive or devoted to psychological security your culture is if half the employees don't have job security..  And the people on the ground know its is terrible but the practice persists for economic reasons (since contractors cost about half what full employees do). Like as a contractor I was not invited to the holiday party, but full time employees that couldn't go would give their invites to contractors; so the employees would work around company policies to mitigate that damage to morale and tea-mates. It was a weird disconnect..  But like I said, Google is a great place to work, you'll meet great people, work on very interesting things, and have opportunities you don't have anywhere else.

1475,5.0,"Great place to start as a TVC, not so good to stay","Google is a wonderful place to work, I wish I never left! As a TVC though, your experience is greatly dependent on what agency you are with. If your agency is timid about asking for more money so that in turn, YOU can continue to climb then you're out of luck. Everyone is pretty collaborative, easy going but hard working. My experience as a TVC was that they didn't care how or when you did something, as long as it was done and on time. You do have to get used to requests from FTE's that can seem frantic, I.E. ""I need this YESTERDAY HELP ME PLEASE!"" but if you can communicate and ease fears of trusting a TVC to complete a task, then you'll do well. Engineers there, both software and hardware, tend to lack communication skills or emotional intelligence so if you can bring that to the role then you'll be greatly appreciated. You get almost all of the same perks like free gym access and food however you do have to pay $1.50 each way on the G Bus shuttles whereas this is free to FTEs. All FTE shopping perks, concerts and happy hours are not extended to TVCs but its not that big of a deal.

1476,5.0,Amazing place but caste system,"Google is an amazing place to work.  However, there is a distinct caste system among employees..  · Full-time employees are all treated great.. · Full-time contractors are treated very well, with most of the same benefits as FTEs, but on fixed-term contracts.. · Temp/Vendor/Contractors are treated well for non-monetary benefits - ie free shuttles, free food, free use of gym & laundry facilities; no insurance, stock options, bonuses, etc..  This is fairly common practice in Silicon Valley.  However, it is the fact that the distinctions between these 3 categories are often blurred, but the TVCs are treated as disposable in a lot of ways..  There is the obvious incentive to work hard as a TVC to earn a promotion to FTC or FTE, but often that path is not transparent and in fact it may be used as an incentive or motivation, when, in actuality, there is no actual path to promotion.","free food, free laundry facilities, free gym facilities, free shuttle service, great HR coverage",

1480,5.0,Worst hiring process I have ever seen,"Google is not a bad place to work if you get in; however, google has the worst hiring process of any company I have ever seen.  The absolute debilitating fear of accidentally hiring the wrong person creates an environment where there is a long winded hiring black box, with almost no feedback what so ever.  You might be in communication with a hiring manager one week getting ready for interviews, and the next week, you are no longer being considered, with no explanation, and having not even interviewed.  Once you have made it through the notoriously difficult 4 hour back to back interviews, there begins a long mysterious process of going through hiring committees and executive reviews, where there is no feedback.  This process took at least a month or more for me, with a solid month between phone and in person interviews,  There was also a delay of a couple months between resume submission and any contact from Google..  Once in to Google, being awesome at your job is not quite good enough to get you promoted.  You need to demonstrate being awesome at the position two levels above you, to be considered for promo.",,

I've met many wonderful people and you certainly can't argue with the perks. If I were a fullitme employee I'm almost certain I'd be writing a stellar review, but as a contractor espite all the wonderful benefits and exciting work environment it is simply hard to shake the feeling of being undervalued. It varries from team to team, but unless your team has a high budget and less need (which is never the case) your wage is going to be just enough to live off of. The freedom to stay late and work overtime is sometimes given, and ultimately that is what one must do to even have a shot at a full time role. I have seen several good friends simply leave however once they were able to get the Google name on their resume and it is hard not to notice that one's talents are in demand and more valued elsewhere. I hope that the internal machinery of the company will catch up to the problem of top talen leaving the company, but I recognize there are resource constraints. Overall I have enjoyed working at Google and there is certainly nothing I'd rate as negative in terms of company culture.","Great Culture, Opportunity for Skill Development","Poor Compnesation, High Time Commitment"

Treatment of TVCs (temps, vendors, and contractors) varies by team and at times it feels like they are considered second-class citizens by management, or ignored altogether. TVCs in some teams can't work from home, use work equipment (laptops, mobile devices etc..) externally, aren't usually entitled to business travel, free Google swag, and most team/company meetings and social events..  As a result many are left feeling a bit ostracised as ""outsiders"". I've never been treated like this as a contractor in my professional career and it leaves a nasty taste in your mouth like you're not trusted or fresh out of college and incompetent..  Converting to a full-time employee is also very hard and being a TVC doesn't really give you a leg-up compared to external candidates. I found recruiters to be disinterested in helping me stay at Google..  Management should treat TVCs better, and less like second class citizens.

2299,4.0,"Excellent culture, great products, but watch out if you're a contract employee","While I highly recommend taking a job at Google if one is offered to you, I would proceed with caution if you are a contract worker (or ""TVC""). There are certain perks and company functions you're not allowed to enjoy, but the biggest caution is that Google is only allowed to keep a temp on for two years. If your contract is renewed after the first year, great. But if they don't hire you on as permanent by the time the second year comes around, start looking for a new gig. In theory, you can be re-hired as a TVC if you are out of the company for a minimum of three months, but I've never seen that happen. .  Again, great job (and free food), but don't expect it to last longer than two years if you are hired as a contract worker.","Culture, highly innovative products",Gig as a contract worker will be two years maximum.

It was like being at the fence of the garden of Eden, looking in at happy Googlers, while sitting just out of reach. Being a Google employee, a ""white badger"", is great. Being a contractor (or TVC as Google calls us) can range from honestly very great, to terrible. If you're a developer who is a contractor, or a manager, life is pretty good. But if you're a worker bee, it's rough. The maps people possibly have the worst of it..  The Google divide is becomes quickly, starkly obvious just after starting. There is no health insurance, and no paid time off when working as a Google Maps surveyor (or any TVC). Traveling extensively, often no where interesting, and staying over the weekend with no option to return home for weeks at a time made this job very hard for me, especially because I have a family. Vacations, even short ones, where highly detrimental to putting food on the table and paying rent..  Google gave me a corporate credit card to pay for daily meals, which was good. BUT the card was heavily micromanaged with daily and weekly reports due for its use. Even though it had a daily expenditure cap. But I was never allowed to gain points for purchases, while my managers quickly become diamond Hilton members making reservations for me... A very clear double standard. You are also expected to enter business spaces and survey but without permission from business and business owners, which didn't sit well with me. .

My co-workers were always very friendly and outgoing. We would all interact about our job and share insight or give advice to one another on how to improve. I've learned how important it is to ask for feedback on work in order to improve as well as give something back to the team. The hardest part of my job was completing the production in a timely manner but my favorite part was when it was finally accomplished at the end of the week.

I learned how to tackle clients in a professional manner and not just to maintain them in our business but also keep them always highly motivated. there was a mixed management and frankly speaking there was huge confusion of hierarchy. example for leave we had to contact our HR person, for incentive one manager, for process clarification training person, for escalation floor walker etc.  Indeed my co-workers are fine people to work with.  the hardest part of job is to be on one single call for more than 50 mins, however most enjoyable part was also the same as the customers used to be very interactive and professional.  overall the experience was good, however I decided to for forward in my career on the finance domain i selected.

2831,3.0,great company concept but not the greatest to work for,A typical day consists of picking up various packages from different stores and delivering those packages to the customers doorstep in a n certain time period.  I've learned how to use my time wisely and to maneuver around the city in a timely manner.  Management was okay. It was a bit unorganized and all over the place but they managed to get the job done.  My co-workers were good but most not trained properly so it effected work efficiency.

The trick is to get into the right field of the company from the get-go because it is tough to maneuver within such a large well-oiled machine of a company. For example, I was in sales for two years, including during a huge company re-organization in which people did not have much say about their team reassignments. In order to get out of sales, it would have taken several promotions, a major recommendation and fighting off fierce competition for the much smaller amount of marketing jobs available. It was smarter to go get my MBA to be able to pursue a field I wanted to pursue than stay at Google through all of that.",,

I communicated with a representative from Google on a daily basis to report my progress..  - The most difficult part of the job was driving long distances after a strenuous day of hiking with heavy equipment on my back..  - The scenery and some of the individuals from Parks Canada were definitely the most enjoyable parts of the job.",Extensive travel,Long or unreliable hours
